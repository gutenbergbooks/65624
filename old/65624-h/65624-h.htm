<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">racing</span> the history of man as far back as we can
under civilized conditions of life, we find that in one
form or another he has made use of some artificial contrivance
to protect his head.</p>

<p>Nature, in her bounty, seems to have provided in part
against the necessity of the hat, by giving to the head a
thick and abundant covering of hair, but, instead of considering
this as an indication that the head required no
other protection, mankind seems rather to have regarded
it as a hint to keep this most important part of the body
well covered.</p>

<p>The hat being the most conspicuous article of dress,
and surmounting all the rest, it is only natural to find that
from the earliest times special care and attention has been
given to its adornment&mdash;showy plumes, rare jewels and
rich bands of gold and silver being used at different periods
to decorate it.</p>

<p>Its form and frequently its color have also been made
to designate the rank and character of the wearer: As the
Monarch by his crown, the Cardinal by his red hat, which
betokens his readiness to spill his blood at any time for the
sake of Christ, and the court fool by his cap with bells. In
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3" name="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>one form it serves to designate the military officer, in another
the peaceful Quaker or the quiet man of letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4" name="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>
<p>The materials employed in the manufacture of hats have
been various, stuffs of every kind and color having entered
into their composition. The birds have been robbed
of their brilliant plumage, the beasts of the field of their
wool and hair. Amphibious creatures have yielded their
fur, while the mines of the earth have given up precious
metals and stones. All these have been used by man to
make a suitable covering for his august head. Felt
hats are by far the most ancient, silk hats being of quite
recent introduction. They were known in Florence about
a century ago, but were not introduced into France until
1825.</p>

<p>Tradition ascribes the discovery of felting to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement.
It occurred in this manner: While on one of his
charity missions, becoming weary and foot-sore, he took off
his sandals to ease his feet, which were all bruised from
long walking over rough roads. While resting by the wayside
an opportunity was afforded him of rescuing a little
lamb from the cruel clutches of a wily fox that was pursuing
it. The grateful little creature jumped round him and
licked his hand for joy, and it was in fondling it that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Clement observed some loose wool, which he gathered.</p>

<p>While carelessly handling it the thought suddenly
struck him that it would be good to bind up the wounds
on his feet with. No sooner was it thought than done, and
he found it so soothing that he immediately resumed his
journey.</p>

<div class="chapter">

</div></div>

<p class="space-above2"></p>

<p>At night when he came to remove his sandals he was
surprised to find, instead of fine, soft wool, a piece of cloth,
so firm and thick that he could not pull it apart. This was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6" name="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>called felt, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement was made the patron saint of
the craft. (However, it is only fair to state that, according
to some authorities, there is abundant evidence to show
that felting was known to the ancients long before the
time of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement or the Christian era.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The most ancient form of head wear we find to be the
cap such as is seen on figures representing the goddess of
liberty. Hoods, also, of various shapes, date back long
before hats appeared, the latter for a long time only being
employed as an article of extra clothing in winter, worn
over the hood or when going on a journey.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the ancient Egyptians very peculiar shaped caps
were worn, like from Figures <a href="#Page_3">1 to 7</a>. Some of them would
rise to a great height above the head, and then descend
very low upon the chest in the shape of lappets. Those of
the priests and of their attendants were often loaded with
a profusion of symbolical decorations, composed of feathers,
lotus leaves and other natural products.</p>

<p>In religious processions it was common to wear masks
that covered the whole head and neck down to the shoulders.
These represented the heads and busts of various
sacred animals, such as the ibis, hawk, bull, dog and ram.</p>

<p>Our modern hat can be traced back to the <em>pileus</em> worn
by the ancient Greeks when on a journey. Hats with brims
were also worn by them, though some authorities claim
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>that the Greek citizen of mature years never wore a head-covering,
it being confined to youths, workmen and slaves.
The <em>pileus</em> was a closely-fitting woolen skull-cap, which was
sometimes worn as a lining to the helmet. It was adopted
by the Romans at their public games and festivals by those
who had once been slaves, and by the aged and infirm for
sake of warmth.</p>

<p>From ancient coins and medals we find that the Romans
went bareheaded, except at sacred rites, games, festivals,
and when at war.</p>

<p>Baldness was looked upon by them as a great deformity,
and Cæsar, mighty conqueror though he was, yet
could not make nature add one single hair to his very
scanty supply, is said to have prized the honor of wearing
a laurel crown above all the other dignities conferred
upon him by the senate, as it served to conceal his
weakness.</p>

<p>In the city, to screen themselves from the heat, rain or
wind, the Romans frequently threw the folds of their robe
over their heads, but if they met any one to whom they
owed respect, they immediately let the folds drop and remained
bareheaded.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#Page_5">10 and 12</a> are specimens of ancient Greek helmets,
while Fig. <a href="#Page_5">11</a> represents a young warrior equipped for battle.
Fig. <a href="#Page_5">8</a> shows the <em>petasus</em>, not greatly unlike our tennis
hat of to-day. Fig. <a href="#Page_5">14</a> is the Phrygian bonnet, which held
its own for so many centuries.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Eastern nations always have their
heads covered. In China the men wear hats in shape and
size resembling large umbrellas, like Figs. <a href="#Page_7">18 and 23</a>, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>else small conical caps similar to Fig. <a href="#Page_7">17</a>. These are made
of beautifully wrought cane-work and often have pictures
of birds and flowers painted upon them. They also have
another cap, which though richer in material is not so
graceful. It is similar in shape to Fig. <a href="#Page_7">22</a>, made of black
velvet with a blue silk centre and a red tassel surmounting
the top. The distinctive mark of different ranks among
the mandarins consists in the color and value of the button
worn on the cap. Figs. <a href="#Page_7">19 and 20</a> show the peculiar
head-dress worn by the Japanese when going forth to
battle. In Arabia, notwithstanding the heat of the climate,
the men wear a most preposterous head-dress. Frequently
fifteen cloth or linen caps are worn one over the
other, the upper one being gorgeously embroidered in gold
with a sentence from the Koran worked upon it. Not satisfied
with this curious coiffure they add to it by wrapping
around the outer cap a large piece of muslin ornamented
at the ends with silk or golden fringe, which stream loosely
on the shoulders.</p>

<p>A plume of white heron’s feathers is the distinctive
badge of a chief among the Uzbek Tartars.</p>

<p>Throughout the East the turban is generally worn, its
height being a mark to denote the rank of the wearer.
In color it is generally of the most brilliant hue, and of
richly embroidered materials. Great taste and ingenuity
are exercised in the manner of twisting it around the head
so as to make the folds appear as graceful as possible.
The different turbans on page <a href="#Page_9">9</a> give some idea of the
various shapes they can be made to assume.</p>

<p>Emirs or Sharifs, descendants of Mohammed’s daughter,
are alone allowed the high honor of adorning their
heads with green turbans.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#Page_11">11</a> we have some types of African head-dress,
Figs. <a href="#Page_11">31, 32 and 34</a> showing what the natives of that dark
continent have done for themselves in the way of head
adornment, entirely unaided by fashion or the knowledge
of what their brothers in other parts of the world were
wearing. Fig. <a href="#Page_11">33</a>, though of Asiatic origin and finer workmanship,
is quite as grotesque in design as anything the
wild tribes of Africa could devise.</p>

<p>At one time the Turks had a law by which none but
themselves could wear turbans of rich texture. Their
Greek subjects were condemned to wear dark cotton caps
as a mark of their servitude. Armenians were compelled
to appear in ridiculous-looking balloon-shaped caps, while
the Jews were only permitted to wear brimless caps resembling
inverted flower-pots. Later on, the Sultan issued a
decree that all of his subjects should wear a red fez instead
of their turbans. This law was received with the most determined
and indignant opposition. So obnoxious to their
feelings was this change, that the discontented party set
fire to the houses of all those who favored it, and though
finally the Sultan’s wishes passed into a law, it was years
before many of his subjects became reconciled to it. Fig. <a href="#Page_13">40</a>
shows a turban worn by one of the Sultans; Fig. <a href="#Page_13">41</a>, the fez
of the people. Figs. <a href="#Page_13">37, 38, 42 and 43</a> on the same page are
samples of Russian hats. In some parts of that country
the head-covering of the people is made of birch bark and
plaited grasses; but fur is the material most commonly
used. The prevailing male head-dress of the inhabitants
of Asia Minor appears to be the Phrygian bonnet, of which
the characteristic features with them are its point on top,
bent forward, and its long flaps descending on the shoulders.
This style of hat was worn for many centuries, and
traveled as far west as Venice, where the Doge always
wore one.</p>

<p>As a part of defensive armor the hat became the helmet,
which has changed but little in shape from the earliest
times. Very elaborate and fantastic were some of the
early forms, with their double or two-story heads, Figs. <a href="#Page_15">46
and 47</a>, to give the impression of increased height. The
workmanship, also, was very beautiful, some of the ancient
helmets being entirely covered with chasing and designs
of the most intricate character. With the Greeks and
Romans the subject of armor was one of importance, and
from their ancient monuments we can learn much of their
form and beauty. Page <a href="#Page_15">15</a> shows several kinds of helmets
worn during the middle ages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Spain serious disturbances took place in Madrid in
the eighteenth century over an attempt being made to
banish the <em>sombrero</em>. While in other countries the fashion
of hats has been undergoing changes, in Spain the same
shapes are worn year after year, with but little modification.
Page <a href="#Page_19">19</a>, with the exception of Figs. <a href="#Page_19">52 and 53</a>,
which are Mexican, show several forms of Spanish hats.
Fig. <a href="#Page_19">51</a> is the style commonly worn by the priests when
traveling about.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_21">21</a> gives some German types; Fig. <a href="#Page_21">61</a> is the hat of
a judge; Figs. <a href="#Page_21">58, 60 and 62</a> are military hats, while Fig. <a href="#Page_21">63</a>
shows a Teutonic fool’s cap decorated with bells.</p>

<p>In France the clothing of the head has long been a subject
of special consideration, and many have been the styles
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>that have emanated from there. At first, as in most of the
other countries mentioned, hoods were worn, but when
Charles <abbr title="the seventh">VII</abbr>. made his triumphal entry into Rouen, in 1449,
he wore a hat lined with red velvet and surmounted with a
rich plume of feathers. From this date hats and caps became
general throughout France.</p>

<p>A curious appendage that was worn with the hat for
many years was like Fig. <a href="#Page_23">66</a>, consisting of a piece of black
stuff which was fastened to one side of the hat, the other
end being thrown over the left shoulder. This band was
often held in the hand and the hat allowed to fall off from
the head and rest on the back.</p>

<p>Another peculiar head-dress was the Capuchin hood,
Fig. <a href="#Page_23">68</a>. This had a long pointed tail that hung down the
back, and in front was buttoned close up to the chin.
Some gallants twisted the tails into all sorts of fantastic
forms and carelessly poised them on the top of the head.
With the shaven faces that were always worn with this
hood, the men all looked very much like monks. It was
fear of this appearance that induced Francis <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>. to set the
fashion of velvet caps in his kingdom. Fig. 67 represents
a French military hat. For the past fifty years the high
silk hat has been the most popular style in France.</p>

<p>At one time there was a law in France which compelled
all bankrupt Jews to wear a green hat, so that people might
avoid losses by trading with them. The slang expression
“Do you see anything green about me,” is said to have
derived its origin from this circumstance.</p>

<p>The early Anglo-Saxons for years wore no other covering
for their heads than their long flowing hair, which they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>sedulously cultivated. When they did take to a covering,
about the eighth century, it was in the form of a cap made
most likely from the undressed skin of animals. The
Britons, at the time of the invasion of Cæsar, wore on
their heads a conical hat, which derived its name from the
cabin or hut in which they lived, it strongly resembling it in
shape. Helmets, with a projecting piece in front called a
nasal, were worn by the early Briton warriors. The nasal
was afterward discarded, as it was found to afford too
convenient a hold to the enemy of the wearer, Stephen,
at the siege of Lincoln, having been seized by the nasal of
his helmet and held a prisoner.</p>

<p>It was not until after the Norman conquest that the use
of hats became general in England. “A hatte of bever”
was worn by some one of the nobles met at Clarendon
about the middle of the twelfth century, and in the “Canterbury
Tales” we hear mention of the merchant wearing
on his head a “Flaunderish bever hat.”</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century we find a very peculiar kind
of head-gear popular in England, Figs. 70 and 72. First,
on the head is a close-fitting skull-cap, which is encircled
by a roll of cloth, flat like a band, or twisted turban-wise.
Above is another piece of cloth, cut and clipped around
the edges in all manner of queer shapes, the whole falling
around the head in a confused manner. Such hoods were
worn by the ancient Knights of the Garter, and are said to
have been borrowed from Italy.</p>

<p>It is in this same century that for the first time in England
we find a feather in the hat, Fig. 75. It was stuck in
perfectly straight in front, as they had not as yet acquired
any grace in its adjustment.</p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Elizabeth a great variety of
hats and caps were worn. They were mostly made of velvet
and richly decorated with jewels, bands of gold or silver
lace and feathers. A writer of that time describes them
thus: “They wear them sharpe on the crowne, peaking up
like the speare or shaft of a steeple, standing a quarter of
a yard above the crowne of the head. Some others are
flatte and broade on the crowne like the battlements of a
house. Another sort have round corners, sometimes with
one sort of band, sometimes another; now black, now
white, now russet, now red, now green, now yellow, now
this, now that&mdash;never content with one color or fashion
two days to an end; and thus they spend the Lord’s
treasure consuming their golden years and silver days
in wickedness and sin.” Those must have been glorious
days for the hatter when the fashions changed so rapidly
that men were obliged to buy a new hat every two or
three days.</p>

<p>During this same reign laws were made compelling the
lower classes to wear on the Sabbath a cap of peculiar
shape and make.</p>

<p>The escape of Lord Nithsdale from the Tower, in the
early part of the eighteenth century, was principally
effected by the large riding-hoods worn at that time, which
he put on, along with his wife’s dress and cloak. Such
hoods were ever after called Nithsdales.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#Page_25">25</a> are pictures of some of the early forms of
English hats. Figs. 76 and 78 belonged to the clergy. Fig.
77 is a Scottish bonnet.</p>

<p>The Puritans discarded all ornament of any kind
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>from their dress and wore the steeple hat, high and
narrow in the crown, with a broad brim (Fig. 83). The
Cavalier of the same era wore a low, broad-crowned
hat with a feather stuck on one side. The principal
changes that have taken place in hats from time to
time have been in the height of the crown and in
the width of the brim. As this latter became wider it
led to the device of looping it up, and thus originated
the cocked hat that was worn during the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>To all Americans this hat brings patriotic recollections
of revolutionary days&mdash;for Washington and his generals all
wore cocked hats. On page <a href="#Page_27">27</a>, Fig. 85, we have the hat of
the “Minute Man.” Also one worn, Fig. 79, during the
good old Knickerbocker days. Fig. 84 shows the style
of hat worn by Kossuth when on a visit to this country in
1851. Previous to this time the only hat made for gentlemen
was the high silk hat and cloth caps for boys, but
a few weeks after Kossuth’s appearance in the country
thousands of hats similar to his were sold, the demand for
them being universal. Since then soft and stiff felt hats
have been brought to perfection in quality and style in
this country far superior to any made abroad. This was
shown in our Centennial Exhibition, in 1876, by Dunlap &amp;
Co. receiving the first prize for their productions over all
competition of foreign and domestic manufactures. Figs.
86, 87, 88 are three different styles of high hats worn about
fifty years ago. In the latter part of the eighteenth
century the gaudy ornaments of lace, jewels, feathers,
&amp;c., gradually began to disappear from hats, giving
place to the sober black band and simple buckle, and
when that, too, had its day and passed away, the hats
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>of men were left without any ornament, but in much
better taste and more in keeping with their use than
were those of old.</p>

<p>Hats have not only been used for the practical purpose
of covering the head, but from remote time have played
their part in many important actions in life. Among the
Romans the hat was the symbol of liberty, and slaves were
presented with one on receiving their freedom. The
Quaker hat dates from the origin of the sect in the middle
of the seventeenth century, Fig. 80. After the assassination
of Cæsar coins were issued by Brutus and Cassius, on
which was represented a cap between two daggers. Even
at a later period the hat or cap was identified with liberty
as in the republic of the Netherlands. After the emancipation
from Spain a hat became their national emblem, while
we all know the part Gessler’s hat played in gaining for
the Swiss their freedom. The common practice of doffing
the hat when meeting a friend is thought to be a
modification of the ancient custom of unclothing some
part of the body when in the presence of one to whom respect
was due.</p>

<p>Many persons profess that from the dress alone they
can give you a true estimate of the character of the man.</p>

<p>While this is, perhaps, expressing it rather strongly, it
is certainly true that the material and style of one’s dress
does, to a large degree, denote the wearer’s character; and
especially is this so of hats and the manner in which they
are worn.</p>

<p>The man of refined tastes will always be found to be
very fastidious in regard to his head wear, buying only the
finest quality of hat, while a coarse nature will be satisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>with a cheap slouch hat. The prosperous business man
also can generally be picked out by his hat, it being something
substantial and good of its kind, while the man of
mean and parsimonious habits will usually have a hat to
correspond with his dwarfed nature.</p>

<p>We have now followed a few of the changes that hats
have undergone from the earliest times to the present, and
would bring our remarks to a close with a notice of
the house of R. Dunlap &amp; Co., which was founded by Mr.
Robert Dunlap in 1857, who opened a small store November
14, at 557 Broadway, between Spring and Prince
streets, and by originality of designs and selling the finest
class of hats, he soon became the popular hatter of the
city. Two years later, in 1859, Mr. Paran Stevens, the
Napoleon of hotel-keepers, induced Mr. Dunlap to occupy
a store under the Fifth Avenue Hotel, which was just then
completed, and who desired only those as tenants who sold
the best goods in their line. At this time the hotel, situated
at the corner of Twenty-third street and Fifth avenue,
was considered very far up town, and it was predicted that
Dunlap’s venture would be a failure; but the young and
enterprising hatter soon became the leading hatter of the
country. The firm remained there for twelve years, and
then removed to their present location, at 178 and 180 Fifth
avenue. Finding the demand for their hats increasing
from the residents of Brooklyn, Jersey City and surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
suburbs, in 1876 they moved their store from 557 to
179 Broadway, near Cortlandt street, as their down-town
store.</p>

<p>The popularity of the Dunlap hat induced the firm to
increase their manufacturing facilities by the erection of a
large factory on Seventh avenue, New York, where all the
silk and opera hats are made, and a straw-hat factory at
132 and 134 South Fifth avenue, New York, and also the
erection of one of the largest and most complete felt hat
factories in this country at the corner of Park and Nostrand
avenues, Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The growing demand for these hats in the West induced
the firm to open a branch store under the Palmer
House, Chicago, about three years ago, which has proved
a grand success; also, quite recently, they have opened an
elegant store on Chestnut street, Philadelphia. Besides
their own stores in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia,
their celebrated hats are sold by authorized agents in all
the principal cities of the United States, where the patrons
of the Dunlap hat can purchase their hats of the
same style, quality and price as sold by them in their own
stores.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
